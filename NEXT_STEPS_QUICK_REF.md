### **3️⃣ API Development (Week 3-5)** 🔌
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Timing:** After VPS stabilizes  
**Why Now?** VPS has fresh data, production testing possible

**Option A: Next.js API Routes** (Recommended ⭐️)
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest bist-data-platform --typescript
# Unified API + Frontend in one project
```

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/companies` - List + search + filter

- `GET /api/financials/:code` - Financial statements

**Features:**
- Pagination & filtering
- Rate limiting & caching
- API documentation (Swagger)
- Connect to VPS PostgreSQL (production data!)

**Deliverable:** Production API ✅ (tested with 3+ weeks of fresh data)

### **4️⃣ Frontend Dashboard (Week 6-11)** 🎨
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Timing:** After API ready  
**Why Now?** VPS has 6+ weeks of historical data

**Stack:**
- Next.js 15 App Router
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Recharts (for financial charts)

**Pages:**

**Deliverable:** Production-ready frontend ✅ (tested with 6-11 weeks of data)

---

### **5️⃣ Public Launch (Week 12)** 🌍
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Timing:** When frontend ready

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Domain purchase + SSL setup
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Setup analytics (Plausible/Google Analytics)
- [ ] Final SEO audit
- [ ] Social media announcement
- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Prepare support channels

**Deliverable:** Public launch ✅ (with 11 weeks of historical data!)

## 📊 Timeline Overview

| Week | Phase | Deliverable | Data Available |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | VPS Deployment | Data collection starts | 0 days |
| 2 | Stabilization + API Design | VPS stable, API spec | 7 days |
| 3-5 | API Development | Production API | 14-35 days ✅ |
| 6-11 | Frontend Development | Production frontend | 42-77 days ✅ |
| 12 | Public Launch | Live system | **77 days** 🎉 |

**Result:** Launch with **11 weeks (77 days) of historical data** ✅

---

## ❓ Why This Order? (VPS First Strategy)

**✅ ADVANTAGES:**
1. Fresh data collection from Week 1 (no opportunity cost)
2. Production environment tested early (lower risk)
3. API/Frontend developed with real production data
4. Launch with 11 weeks of historical data (better UX)
5. Parallel development possible (VPS + API)

**❌ ALTERNATIVE (API/Frontend First) PROBLEMS:**
1. 9 weeks of stale data during development
2. VPS issues discovered late (Week 10+)
3. Launch with only 2 weeks of data (poor UX)
4. Higher risk (production testing delayed)
